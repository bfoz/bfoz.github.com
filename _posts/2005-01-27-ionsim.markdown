A few weekends ago I made a page for a new TDC project called [IonSim](http://terrandev.com/projects/ionsim/). Its going to be a particle simulator for looking at charged particle motion. I'm planning to go with a direct method (probably Runge-Kutta) instead of a statistical method because I think the results will be more accurate. In this modern age of cheap (and networked) computing power the added computational requirements shouldn't be a problem. We'll see.
