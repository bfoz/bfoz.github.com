I just read the [interview](http://www.drunkenblog.com/drunkenblog-archives/000369.html) linked from [Slashdot](http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/01/08/1556209&tid=123&tid=3) about the folks being sued by [Apple](http://apple.com) for distributing Tiger. I see how they screwed up and how the resulting suits are technically justified. But three things come to mind. 1) This smells like a legal knee-jerk type thing. There was no real damage caused by the release and Apple is going to loose a lot of karma over this. It makes me wonder if the lawyers are running amuk or if the the top brass actually signed off on it. 2) Maybe the recording industry has used iTunes to infect [Apple](http://apple.com). They're the only other industry that sues its die-hard customers. 3) Early in the interview desicanuk says that  [Apple](http://apple.com)  indicated they weren't likely to sue if he cooperated. He cooperated and then they sued him.
