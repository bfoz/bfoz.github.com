For a while I've been thinking that it would be possible to make a set of brackets that could be used to string RC servos together into mechanical linkages. Of course, I say "linkages" when I mean legs. I've been interested in walking robots for a long time, but never got around to doing anything about it. So in my spare time I think about starting a company selling these brackets and associated paraphenalia. Until today, when I ran across [Lynxmotion](http://www.lynxmotion.com/ViewPage.aspx?ContentCode=Home), which sells exactly what I was thinking about. So much for my company. On the plus side, now I have somewhere to buy the stuff and don't have to waste time designing it myself.
