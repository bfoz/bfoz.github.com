[This](http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/asimov.htm) is hilarious. The first entry is from 1981, but it reads like it could have been written today. Simply update the name of the US President and make a few changes to the bits about Ireland, and it sounds completely contemporary. Which, if you think about it, is a bit sad.
