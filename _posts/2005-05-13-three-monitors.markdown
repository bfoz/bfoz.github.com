Recently Fry's was offering the Samsung SyncMaster 730B 17" LCD with some nice juicy rebates. I've been wanting to upgrade my old 17" CRT (also a SyncMaster) for some time and, of course, I've alway had the dream of a multi-head setup in mind. So I splurged and bought three. Yes, three. And yes, this makes me an enormous dork. But I don't care because I've discovered just how useful a multi-head setup can be.

In case anyone cares, I'm using an AGP geForce 5900 and a PCI geForce 5700LE. The AGP card is setup for TwinView and then the two cards are combined with Xinerama to make one huge screen. Enlightenment seems to have some issues with always placing new windows on the left most monitor. It didn't have that problem when I was tinkering with only two monitors (I added one at a time to experiment).  With just the twinview setup new windows appeared on the screen with the cursor, but not any more. A minor annoyance I guess.

The biggest downside so far is that Doom3 won't run anymore (in win2k; its a dual-boot machine). But I haven't looked for any workarounds yet. I still need to try Mechwarrior too.
