[This](http://artofmanliness.com/2008/05/14/100-must-read-books-the-essential-mans-library) was on [Digg](http://digg.com/educational/100_Must_Read_Books_The_Essential_Man_s_Library) a few days ago and I finally got around to reading it. Seems like a pretty good list. I haven't read everything on it, but I have read a few and I'm thinking I should put some effort into a few more of them. Ben Franklin's autobiography sounds like a good one.
