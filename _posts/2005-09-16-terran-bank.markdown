Today I installed the server for [Terran Bank](http://terran-bank.com) at the [ColoServe](http://coloserve.com) colo facility in San Francisco. The install went pretty smooth, despite having no idea what I was doing. The first two techs that I came across seemed just as clueless, although eager to help. The service is definitely geared towards people who already know what they're doing. Noobies have to fend for themselves, or work up the courage to ask stupid questions.

My biggest problem was figuring out how to mount the rails on the rack, which I have never done before. It turned out to be brain-dead simple, but the rails I purchased came with the brackets set for a 4-post rack (they had 2-post racks) so it was a bit confusing at first. Fortunately, there were racks and racks of "example" installations to look at, so it didn't take too long to figure it out. After that, it was just a matter of hooking everything up and applying power. Upon first powerup the network drop didn't work, despite having a full set of link lights, but the support staff jumped on it and quickly traced the problem to a crossed cable. Its been smooth sailing ever since (admittedly its only been 4 hours).

For those who care, I decided to go with [ColoServe](http://coloserve.com) because their rates seem good for around here and they're only an hour away from me. There's actually a place just down the street, but the price was a bit high. I'm banking on not having to drive to SF very often. The facility itself is supposedly an old WWII tank depot. It certainly looks the part, the building appears rather solid inside and out. A good place to keep valuables.

For now the website doesn't have much, just a "coming soon" page, but I plan to fix that over the next few days.
