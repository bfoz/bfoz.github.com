> "Knowledge without application is useless. Application without knowledge is superstition"

I was pretty sure I had heard or read that quote somewhere, but I can't think of where and I just couldn't get Google to dredge it up. Eventually I realized I got it wrong, and managed to find it:

> ["Without knowledge action is useless and knowledge without action is futile"](http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/a/abubakr219641.html) - [Abu Bakr](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Bakr)

I like my version better :)

A somewhat apropos lesson for us all, given the recent hand-wringing over [Apophis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99942_Apophis).
