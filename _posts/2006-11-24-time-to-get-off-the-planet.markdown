I just watched the DVD of [An Inconvenient Truth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Inconvenient_Truth). It was released a few days ago and [Netflix](http://netflix.com) was pretty quick in getting it out.

Now I'm more convinced than ever that it's time to get off the planet. Sure, I support mending our ways and trying to cleanup the damage, and I hope it works. But I don't trust people to make the necessary changes in time. I'm not sure there is enough time, even if enough people make enough changes. I'd rather have a safety net to fall back on in case things don't go well. Someplace not on this planet.
