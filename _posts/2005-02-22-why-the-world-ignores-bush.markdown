I just read this Time [opinion peice](http://www.time.com/time/columnist/karon/article/0,9565,1029937,00.html?cnn=yes). I was thinking something along these lines just last week, but had difficulty explaining it to a friend. Although I didn't try very hard...it was just a rambling string of thoughts at the time. The author does a much better job.
