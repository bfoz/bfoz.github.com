Last weekend I went to [Yosemite](http://www.nps.gov/yose/) and did [Half Dome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half_Dome) with the Wu sisters, et al. The weekend before that was [Big Sur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Sur). Both excellent trips arranged by Eileen. Here are two sets of pics from [Eileen](http://picasaweb.google.com/eileenw/CaliTourYNP08) and [Chris](http://picasaweb.google.com/cderespino/Yosemite). I really need to buy a new camera.
