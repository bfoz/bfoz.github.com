How does one advertise a new service? So far the web traffic for [Terran Bank](http://terran-bank.com) has been anemic. Which isn't surprising because I haven't put any effort into "getting the word out" and it's not linked from hardly anywhere. So today I tried a little experiment and posted a short [text advertisement](http://www.craigslist.org/sby/cps/166202444.html) in the computer services section of [Craigslist](http://craigslist.com). Better than nothing, right? Actually, no. It's exactly nothing.

My post was pushed off the first page so fast there's no way anyone saw it. Checking the server stats seems to confirm that theory. Talk about low signal to noise ratio. But, on the plus side, it was a good experiment. Now I know just how much a free post is worth. All the same, I'm going to try extending the experiment a bit and posting every few days while trying not to run afoul of the moderators. Maybe persistence will pay off. In the meantime I have a few more things I want to add to [Terran Bank](http://terran-bank.com).
