Today a friend sent me [Origin of Quake3's Fast InvSqrt()](http://www.beyond3d.com/articles/fastinvsqrt/) (and [Part 2](http://www.beyond3d.com/articles/fastinvsqrt2/)). It brought back memories of a misspent youth playing with the sort of low level code the article talks about. And nearly worshiping some of the people mentioned. It's also a bit of a sobering reminder that I've strayed far from those days, and that I haven't accomplished anything nearly as noteworthy as that one single function. I need to get off my ass and get moving.
