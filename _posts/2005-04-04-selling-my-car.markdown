It's time to say goodbye to my first car. It has served me well for the past two years. A few weeks ago I bought a 2005 BMW 330XI. I wanted to get a new car before the new 2006 body style came out (it looks hideous) and I was tired of driving an automatic. So, the old car must go. I decided to give eBay a try...this is Silicon Valley after all. So check out my [auction](http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=4541300380). Anyone want to buy a car?
