After some pondering and consultation with Tim I redid the [TSA](http://terranspace.org) page. Still not sure if it should be Terran Space Agency or Terran Aeronautics and Space Agency. TSA is too close to the [Transportation Safety Administration](http://www.tsa.dot.gov) and TASA is too close to [NASA](http://www.nasa.gov), neither of which are good to be associated with right now. I guess for the moment we'll just stick with TSA.

I finally got Mailman working properly behind NAT and opened a public list for TSA called [tsa-chat](http://neptune.homeunix.net/mailman/listinfo/tsa-chat), which for now is just a catchall list. Hopefully I'll get the Jabber server working next weekend.
