I finally got around to taking pictures of my new car. It was mostly a matter of finding the motivation and a sunny day. We've been having a lot of rain lately so the car really needed to be washed first. Recently we've been having a few days of rain followed by a few days of sunny, but chilly, weather and then more rain, which really kills the motivation to go out and wash the car. At least, that's my excuse.

As I suspected, the new rims are significantly more tedious to clean than the rims on the 325, which is compounded by the enourmous amount of dust the brakes seem to be generating. I haven't been braking that hard, so I'm hoping this is just new-brakes-syndrome. The wort parts of the new rims are the lug nut counter-sink holes because they're not much bigger than the nuts themselves. Consequently I quickly gave up on cleaning inside the countersinnks. I did manage to get everything else clean, but walked away with one skinned knuckle. Anyway, the point of this post was to provide a link to the [pictures](http://bfoz.net/gallery/bmw330xi_2005).
