The day has finally come. I banished the last of the gremlins yesterday, and after a night of successful testing (in case they were Apr 1 gremlins), the site is finally ready to go. So, without further ado, I give you [Terran Bank](http://terran-bank.com).

Ok, ok, so there's not much to see. I'm working on that. But, for now, the basic functionality (file storage and backup) is all there and working. I have a long list of features that I've been holding off on implementing until after going live (that would be today), and now I can finally start working on them. Feel free to make suggestions. The most-often requested features will be implemented first.
