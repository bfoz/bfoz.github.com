What a pain. It's the little things that really get you. Like going to the grocery store and realizing the clerk is going ask you "Paper or Plastic?".

I'm not even sure how I lost my voice. I had a bad cough Saturday night for no apparent reason, then woke up on Sunday sounding like a dying frog.

I had a phone interview this morning that I had to reschedule for tomorrow. But, it's 10pm and I still don't sound any better than I did this morning.
