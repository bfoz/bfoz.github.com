Lately I've actually been putting a little effort in getting [Terran Bank](http://terran-bank.com) to render decently on IE6. But, it's slow going because IE doesn't come with a DOM inspector. So I've been looking for something better. At first I found [IE DOM Inspector](http://www.ieinspector.com), which is decent, but it's tethered to the bottom of the window it's inspecting. Or at least I couldn't find a way to undock it. Either way, it's shareware with a 30 day expiration, so I kept searching. Tonight I found [DHTMLSpy](http://downloads-zdnet.com.com/DHTMLSpy/3000-2068_2-10538257.html), which is a little more like the [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/) version, with the added bonus of being Freeware. It's not perfect, but it gets the job done for now.

What do other people use? Am I missing a better tool?
