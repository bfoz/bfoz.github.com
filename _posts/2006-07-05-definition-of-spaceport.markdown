I just stumbled upon [Space Cynic](http://www.space-cynic.blogspot.com/), which was linked from [SpaceNow](http://bfoz.net/spacenow.ca) (which currently has a very annoying embedded link to NASA TV that autoplays on page load). In general I try to avoid the space blogs. They're mostly armchair-general style gossip and pontification. What else could they be? It's not like we have a thriving space travel industry to talk about. Even if we did, it would probably be as exciting as the commercial airline industry.

Lately I've been a little bored (or burnt-out) so I've been browsing, just to check on the state of things. Apparently there are some kernels of intelligent conversation popping up. Not much, but a little. At least with the VSE and the commercial spaceport fad they have something to debate now.

Which brings me to my very minor point. [This Space Cynic post](http://space-cynic.blogspot.com/2006/07/ports-and-theme-parks-are-incompatible.html) is apparently part of a running discussion that I've mostly missed and is now focusing on the definition of the word 'Spaceport'. The post in question likens the word, and it's implications, to 'airport' and 'seaport' and argues that traditional ports are places people go for a specific purpose (travel) and not to generally hang out and shop. Which, in general, I agree with. However, some years ago I worked as an intern on the construction of the new terminal at Washington National Airport. I remember one of the big selling points for the terminal was the inclusion of a shopping mall-like area outside of the secure area so people (non-travelers) could come and shop. The idea being to provide a second revenue stream for the airport aside from its regular travel services.

Of course, that was all before the airports were locked down by the security czars. I wonder how that idea is doing today? I live on the west coast now, so I can't really see for myself. But it does leave one to wonder how implementing such an idea at a spaceport would fair any better, or worse.

One of the biggest problems I see with the idea is that people like to shop places that are convenient, and that usually means close to home or work. However, as any airport manager can tell you, people who live near airports continually complain about the noise. As to why they complain about it after knowingly moving in next to an airport is a whole other discussion. The point being that rockets are a lot louder than airplanes. So I'm really not sure how all of this is supposed to work out.
