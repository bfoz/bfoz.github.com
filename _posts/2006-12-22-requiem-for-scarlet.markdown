Two days ago (Wednesday) my [first motorcycle](http://bfoz.net/gallery/v/First+Bike/) was stolen. It was parked in front of my car when I left for work in the morning, but when I got home it was gone. I only had her for 3 weeks, but it was a good 3 weeks and she was one sweet bike. Maybe your first one always is, but that doesn't really matter right now.

There's always the chance the police will find her, but it's a small chance, and certainly not in good shape. I'd like to be hopeful, but I just can't muster it right now.

Rest In Peace Scarlet. I barely knew ye.
