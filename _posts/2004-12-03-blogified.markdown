So I finally got around to starting a blog. I have no real reason for one, but it seems like a good place for random stuff. Originally I had planned to write my own software since I couldn't find anything that was PHP, decent and not GPL. But laziness and a preponderance of "stuff" took care of that idea. Recently I stumbled on WordPress, which isn't perfect but it gets 2 out of 3 points (PHP and decent).  So WordPress it is; until it dies or I find something better.

I took the few comments that were here before and put them into WordPress manually. The post times show up as midnight since I have no idea what time I originally wrote them. Midnight seems about right though.

Now what exactly _am_ I going to do with this thing?
