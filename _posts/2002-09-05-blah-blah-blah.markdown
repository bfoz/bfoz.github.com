Summer is effectively over here in the eastern US and the stores are full of back to school specials. I'm not in school anymore, yet somehow this still seems like a bad thing. Habit I guess. Or maybe its because I've been relaxing all summer and not worrying too much about finding a job, or anything else. Now that summer is over, I need to figure out what to do with myself.
