I had a hard drive fail in my server a few months back. I thought I had restored everything, but it appears some of the web pages weren't backed up properly. Somehow the [QProg](http://bfoz.net/projects/qprog) page lost an entire year worth of updates.

I was hoping the [WaybackMachine](http://archive.org) would have grabbed it, but apparently it hasn't bothered to archive my site since 2006. I guess I'm just not that important.

Anyway, the QProg page should be mostly reconstructed Real Soon Now.
