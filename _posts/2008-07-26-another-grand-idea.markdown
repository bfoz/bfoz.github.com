Long ago I had a [grand delusion](http://terranspace.org/) about creating an open source space agency. Today I had another one while reading [Pale Blue Dot](http://www.amazon.com/Pale-Blue-Dot-Vision-Future/dp/0345376595/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1217106805&sr=8-1). Well, actually it was [Carl Sagan's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan) idea, but I like it. Here it is in his words:

> My wish on the evening and morning star is this: that late in the twenty-first century some great ship, on its regular gravity-assisted trip to the outer Solar System, intercepts this ancient derelict and heaves it aboard, so it can be displayed in a museum of early space technology-on Mars, or Europa, or Iapetus.

The "ancient derelict" he refers to is [Mariner 2](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=4&url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FMariner_2&ei=AZSLSL2rEYqstQODrt3zDw&usg=AFQjCNFzGt5peUaGJQeC7uP234Q9oh_m2w). Apparently it was left in an orbit around the Sun, and is presumably still there. Retrieving it would certainly be a grand undertaking. I'm not too keen on waiting till the end of the century, and there aren't any museums outside of Earth (that I know of), but otherwise it sounds like a fun project. Any takers?
