I finally got around to upgrading my Aluminum PowerBook to OS X Leopard. I have a few reports that [QProg](http://bfoz.net/projects/qprog/) doesn't like Leopard, so I figured it's time to finally get with the program. And, I've been working on a patch to [Hardware Growler](http://growl.info/documentation/hardwaregrowler.php)...no sense developing in the past.

The upgrade went fairly smoothly. Although, it took about 3 hours. All that waiting just to find out I liked Tiger better. Oh well.

The translucent menu bar really annoyed me; probably because my background image is very dark on one side and light on the other. An option for toggling translucency was added in the 10.5.2 update, but I didn't know that at first, so my first impression wasn't good. Unfortunately, that option didn't get rid of the overblown gradient on the menubar. It's just too dark.

The new _Dock_ isn't great, but not as bad as I expected. _Stacks_ is annoying in any mode other than _List_. I don't like the way the _Downloads_ icon on the _Dock_ is hidden by a file icon. How does it pick a file to use? I put a link to an NFS mounted volume on my _Dock_ and it also got hidden by a file icon. How rude.

Maybe Apple will see the light and release a patch one of these days. Not likely, but one can hope.
